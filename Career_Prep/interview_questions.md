## 🔹 **5. What is a SIEM and why is it important?**  
**Answer:**  
A **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)** collects, correlates, and analyzes logs from multiple systems to detect suspicious activity.  
It helps SOC analysts:  
- identify threats  
- investigate incidents  
- respond quickly  
- maintain visibility across the environment  

---

## 🔹 **6. Walk me through how you would investigate a suspicious login.**  
**Strong answer includes:**  
- Check SIEM logs  
- Look at source IP  
- Check geolocation  
- Review timestamps  
- Compare to user behavior  
- Look for MFA failures  
- Check for lateral movement  
- Document findings  

---

## 🔹 **7. What is phishing and how do you detect it?**  
**Answer:**  
Phishing is a social engineering attack designed to trick users into revealing sensitive information.  
Detection includes:  
- suspicious sender  
- mismatched URLs  
- urgent language  
- unexpected attachments  
- poor grammar  
- user reports  

---

## 🔹 **8. What is the difference between TCP and UDP?**  
**Answer:**  
- **TCP:** connection‑oriented, reliable, slower  
- **UDP:** connectionless, faster, no guarantee of delivery  

---

## 🔹 **9. What is least privilege?**  
**Answer:**  
Users should only have the minimum access required to perform their job — nothing more.  
This reduces attack surface and limits damage from compromised accounts.

---

## 🔹 **10. What steps would you take if you discovered malware on a workstation?**  
**Strong answer includes:**  
- isolate the machine  
- preserve evidence  
- collect logs  
- identify malware type  
- remove malware  
- patch vulnerabilities  
- document the incident  
- follow escalation procedures  

---

## 🔹 **11. What is multi‑factor authentication (MFA) and why is it important?**  
**Answer:**  
MFA requires two or more verification methods.  
It significantly reduces account compromise by adding layers of security.

---

## 🔹 **12. What is the difference between IDS and IPS?**  
**Answer:**  
- **IDS:** detects and alerts  
- **IPS:** detects and blocks  

---

## 🔹 **13. What is a false positive vs. false negative?**  
**Answer:**  
- **False positive:** alert triggered but no real threat  
- **False negative:** real threat but no alert triggered  

---

## 🔹 **14. What tools have you used in your labs or projects?**  
Examples you can mention:  
- Splunk  
- Wireshark  
- Zeek  
- Suricata  
- Linux CLI  
- Python scripts  
- TryHackMe labs  
- Google Cybersecurity Certificate tools  

---

## 🔹 **15. Do you have any questions for us?**  
**Always ask something. Examples:**  
- “What does success look like in this role?”  
- “How does your SOC team collaborate during incidents?”  
- “What tools and technologies will I be working with?”
