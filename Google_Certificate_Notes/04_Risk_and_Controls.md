# Risk and Controls  
*Google Cybersecurity Certificate — Module Notes*

---

## **1. What Is Risk?**
Risk is the potential for loss, damage, or negative impact when a threat exploits a vulnerability.

### **Risk Formula**
```
Risk = Threat × Vulnerability × Impact
```

### **Key Terms**
- **Threat:** Anything that can cause harm  
- **Vulnerability:** Weakness that can be exploited  
- **Impact:** Consequences if the threat succeeds  

---

## **2. Types of Risk**
### **Operational Risk**
Failures in processes, systems, or people.

### **Technical Risk**
Weaknesses in software, hardware, or configurations.

### **Human Risk**
User error, social engineering, insider threats.

### **Compliance Risk**
Failure to meet legal or regulatory requirements.

---

## **3. Risk Management Lifecycle**
1. **Identify** – assets, threats, vulnerabilities  
2. **Assess** – evaluate likelihood and impact  
3. **Prioritize** – determine which risks matter most  
4. **Treat** – apply controls  
5. **Monitor** – continuously review and update  

---

## **4. Risk Treatment Options**
### **Mitigate**
Reduce risk with controls (firewalls, MFA, patches).

### **Transfer**
Shift risk to another party (insurance, outsourcing).

### **Accept**
Acknowledge risk and take no action.

### **Avoid**
Eliminate the risk entirely (remove system, disable feature).

---

## **5. Security Controls**
Controls reduce risk and protect assets.

### **Administrative Controls**
Policies, procedures, training  
Examples:  
- security awareness training  
- acceptable use policies  
- incident response plans  

### **Technical Controls**
Technology‑based protections  
Examples:  
- firewalls  
- encryption  
- MFA  
- antivirus  
- SIEM tools  

### **Physical Controls**
Protect physical access  
Examples:  
- locks  
- cameras  
- security guards  
- access badges  

---

## **6. Defense in Depth**
A layered security strategy where multiple controls protect assets.

Example layers:
- physical security  
- network security  
- endpoint security  
- application security  
- user training  

If one layer fails, others still provide protection.

---

## **7. Vulnerability Management**
Process of identifying, evaluating, and addressing vulnerabilities.

### **Steps**
1. **Scan** – identify vulnerabilities  
2. **Assess** – determine severity  
3. **Prioritize** – based on risk  
4. **Remediate** – patch, update, reconfigure  
5. **Verify** – confirm fix  

### **Common Tools**
- Nessus  
- OpenVAS  
- Qualys  

---

## **8. Patch Management**
Keeping systems updated to reduce vulnerabilities.

### **Patch Types**
- security patches  
- bug fixes  
- feature updates  

### **Best Practices**
- test patches before deployment  
- prioritize critical vulnerabilities  
- maintain patch schedules  

---

## **9. Access Control Models**
### **RBAC (Role‑Based Access Control)**
Access based on job role.

### **ABAC (Attribute‑Based Access Control)**
Access based on attributes (location, device, time).

### **MAC (Mandatory Access Control)**
Strict, system‑enforced access (used in military/government).

---

## **10. Security Policies**
Policies guide organizational security behavior.

Examples:
- password policy  
- acceptable use policy  
- data classification policy  
- incident response policy

## **Summary**
This module covers risk concepts, risk treatment, security controls, defense in depth, vulnerability management, and access control models. Understanding how to identify, assess, and mitigate risk is essential for cybersecurity professionals and SOC analysts.
