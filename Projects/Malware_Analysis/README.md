# Malware Analysis  
*A structured investigation of suspicious files and malicious behavior.*

---

## **Overview**
This project demonstrates foundational malware analysis skills using safe, controlled samples.  
The goal is to understand how malware behaves, what indicators it leaves behind, and how to document findings like a SOC analyst or incident responder.

This analysis focuses on:
- identifying malicious characteristics  
- reviewing file metadata  
- analyzing behavior in a sandbox  
- extracting indicators of compromise (IOCs)  
- documenting findings and recommended actions  

---

## **Objectives**
- Perform static and behavioral analysis  
- Identify suspicious file attributes  
- Extract IOCs (hashes, domains, IPs, registry changes)  
- Understand malware persistence techniques  
- Document findings clearly and professionally  

---

## **Tools Used**
- VirusTotal  
- Hybrid Analysis  
- Any.Run (sandbox)  
- Strings utility  
- Hashing tools (SHA‑256, MD5)  
- Linux CLI  

---

## **Analysis Steps**
### **1. File Identification**
- Collected file metadata  
- Calculated hashes (MD5, SHA‑1, SHA‑256)  
- Checked reputation on VirusTotal  

### **2. Static Analysis**
- Reviewed strings for suspicious content  
- Checked for embedded URLs, commands, or indicators  
- Examined file structure and metadata  

### **3. Behavioral Analysis**
- Executed sample in a sandbox environment  
- Observed:
  - network connections  
  - file system changes  
  - registry modifications  
  - process creation  
  - persistence attempts  

### **4. IOC Extraction**
Collected indicators such as:
- file hashes  
- malicious domains  
- suspicious IP addresses  
- registry keys  
- dropped files  

---

## **Key Findings**
- Malware attempted outbound connections to suspicious IP addresses  
- Created persistence via registry modification  
- Dropped additional payloads into temporary directories  
- Exhibited behavior consistent with credential‑stealing malware  

---

## **Recommendations**
- Block identified IPs and domains  
- Remove persistence mechanisms  
- Reimage affected systems if necessary  
- Enforce MFA to reduce credential theft impact  
- Conduct user awareness training  

---

## **Skills Demonstrated**
- Malware triage  
- Static and dynamic analysis  
- IOC extraction  
- Threat intelligence enrichment  
- Documentation and reporting  
- Analytical thinking

## **Disclaimer**
All analysis was performed using **safe, controlled, non‑harmful samples** in isolated environments.  
No live malware was executed on production systems.
