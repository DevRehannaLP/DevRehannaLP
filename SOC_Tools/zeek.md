# Zeek  
*A powerful network security monitoring tool used for deep traffic analysis and detection.*

---

## **Overview**
Zeek (formerly Bro) is a network security monitoring framework that analyzes network traffic and generates structured logs.  
Unlike Wireshark, which captures packets, **Zeek focuses on behaviors, metadata, and high‑level events**, making it ideal for SOC analysts and threat hunters.

---

## **Key Features**
- Protocol analysis (HTTP, DNS, SSL/TLS, SSH, FTP, SMB, etc.)  
- Behavioral detection  
- Script‑based customization  
- High‑level event logs  
- IOC extraction  
- Real‑time monitoring or offline PCAP analysis

## **Common Zeek Logs**

| Log File | Purpose |
|----------|----------|
| `conn.log` | Connection metadata (IP, ports, duration, bytes) |
| `dns.log` | DNS queries and responses |
| `http.log` | HTTP requests, user‑agents, URLs |
| `ssl.log` | TLS handshake metadata |
| `files.log` | File transfers, hashes |
| `weird.log` | Anomalies and unexpected behavior |
| `notice.log` | Alerts generated by Zeek scripts |

These logs are gold for SOC investigations.

## **How SOC Analysts Use Zeek**
- Identify suspicious DNS queries  
- Detect beaconing patterns  
- Analyze HTTP traffic for malware callbacks  
- Review TLS metadata for anomalies  
- Track lateral movement  
- Extract file hashes from network traffic  
- Correlate Zeek logs with SIEM alerts  

---

## **Running Zeek on a PCAP**
```
zeek -r traffic.pcap
```

This generates a folder of logs you can analyze.

## **Useful Investigation Techniques**

### **1. Reviewing conn.log**
Look for:
- unusual ports  
- long‑duration connections  
- repeated short connections (beaconing)  
- large outbound data transfers  

### **2. Analyzing dns.log**
Red flags:
- random‑looking domains  
- excessive DNS queries  
- queries to known malicious domains  

### **3. Inspecting http.log**
Check for:
- suspicious user‑agents  
- odd URLs  
- POST requests to unknown servers  

### **4. Checking ssl.log**
Useful for:
- JA3 fingerprinting  
- identifying suspicious TLS clients  
- detecting encrypted C2 channels  

### **5. Investigating weird.log**
This log highlights:
- protocol violations  
- unexpected behavior  
- potential reconnaissance

## **Common Threat Indicators in Zeek Logs**
- DNS queries to algorithm‑generated domains  
- Repeated periodic connections (C2 beaconing)  
- Suspicious JA3 fingerprints  
- HTTP requests with encoded payloads  
- Large outbound transfers to unknown IPs  
- Failed SSL handshakes

- Network security monitoring  
- Log analysis  
- Threat hunting  
- Behavioral detection  
- IOC extraction  
- PCAP‑to‑log workflows
