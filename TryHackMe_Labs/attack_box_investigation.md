# Attack Box Investigation  
*A TryHackMe room focused on analyzing attacker activity, reviewing logs, and identifying compromise indicators.*

---

## Overview
This room simulates an environment where an attacker has interacted with a system.  
Your task is to investigate what happened, identify malicious actions, and extract indicators of compromise.

---

## Objectives
- Review system logs for attacker activity  
- Identify executed commands and processes  
- Analyze network connections  
- Extract IOCs  
- Reconstruct attacker behavior  
- Strengthen incident investigation skills  

---

## Key Concepts Learned
- Attack chain reconstruction  
- Log correlation  
- Privilege escalation indicators  
- Persistence mechanisms  
- Network-based attacker behavior  

---

## Tools Used
- Linux CLI  
- Log files (`auth.log`, `bash_history`, etc.)  
- Network utilities  
- TryHackMe Attack Box environment

- Authentication attempts  
- Suspicious logins  
- Failed login patterns  

### 2. Command History  
- Commands executed  
- Suspicious binaries  
- File modifications  

### 3. Process & Network Activity
