# Linux Fundamentals  
*A foundational TryHackMe room introducing Linux commands, permissions, navigation, and system management.*

---

## **Overview**
Linux Fundamentals covers the essential skills needed to navigate and operate a Linux system — a critical requirement for SOC analysts, cybersecurity professionals, and anyone working with servers or security tools.

This write‑up serves as a structured template for documenting your progress and findings.

---

## **Objectives**
- Learn basic Linux navigation and file system structure  
- Understand users, groups, and permissions  
- Practice essential commands (ls, cd, cat, grep, chmod, etc.)  
- Explore processes and system management  
- Work with files, directories, and text manipulation  
- Strengthen command‑line confidence  

---

## **Key Concepts Learned**

### **1. Linux File System Structure**
Common directories:
- `/home` — user directories  
- `/etc` — configuration files  
- `/var` — logs and variable data  
- `/bin` & `/usr/bin` — essential binaries  
- `/tmp` — temporary files  

### **2. Essential Commands**
Navigation:
```
ls
cd
pwd
```

File operations:
```
cat
touch
mkdir
rm
cp
mv
```

Permissions:
```
chmod
chown
ls -l
```

Searching:
```
grep
find
```

System info:
```
ps
top
whoami
uname -a
```

### **3. Users & Permissions**
Understanding:
- read, write, execute  
- owner, group, others  
- numeric vs symbolic permissions  

### **4. Processes & Services**
- listing processes  
- killing processes  
- checking running services  

---

## **Tools Used**
- Linux terminal  
- Built‑in command‑line utilities  
- TryHackMe’s Linux learning environment
