# Malware Analysis Basics  
*A TryHackMe room introducing foundational malware analysis concepts, tools, and investigation techniques.*

---

## **Overview**
Malware Analysis Basics teaches the core skills needed to understand how malicious software behaves, how to analyze suspicious files, and how to extract indicators of compromise (IOCs).  
This room focuses on static and behavioral analysis — essential skills for SOC analysts and incident responders.

This write‑up serves as a structured template for documenting your findings once you complete the room.

## **Objectives**
- Understand what malware is and how it operates  
- Learn the difference between static and dynamic analysis  
- Explore common malware behaviors and indicators  
- Practice analyzing suspicious files  
- Extract IOCs such as hashes, domains, and IPs  
- Strengthen triage and investigation skills  

---

## **Key Concepts Learned**

### **1. Types of Malware**
Examples include:
- trojans  
- ransomware  
- worms  
- keyloggers  
- backdoors  
- droppers  

### **2. Static Analysis**
Performed **without executing** the file.  
Common techniques:
- hashing (MD5, SHA256)  
- strings extraction  
- metadata review  
- PE header analysis  
- identifying suspicious imports  

### **3. Dynamic Analysis**
Performed **by executing** the file in a controlled environment.  
Focus areas:
- process behavior  
- file system changes  
- registry modifications  
- network activity  
- persistence mechanisms  

### **4. Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**
Examples:
- file hashes  
- domains and IP addresses  
- mutexes  
- registry keys  
- dropped files  
- suspicious strings  

---

## **Tools Used**
- Strings utility  
- Hashing tools (sha256sum, certutil, etc.)  
- PE analysis tools  
- Sandbox environment (TryHackMe)  
- Network monitoring tools (if provided)

## **Investigation Steps (Template)**  
*(Fill these in after completing the room.)*

### **1. File Identification**
Document:
- file name  
- file type  
- size  
- hashes (MD5, SHA1, SHA256)  

### **2. Static Analysis**
Examples:
- extracted strings  
- suspicious imports  
- embedded URLs or IPs  
- metadata observations  

### **3. Behavioral Analysis**
Record:
- processes spawned  
- files created or modified  
- registry changes  
- network connections  
- persistence attempts  

### **4. IOC Extraction**
List:
- domains  
- IP addresses  
- file hashes  
- registry paths  
- filenames  
- any other artifacts  

### **5. Threat Classification**
Possible categories:
- trojan  
- downloader  
- ransomware  
- backdoor  
- info‑stealer
