# Zeek Logs Analysis  
*A TryHackMe room focused on analyzing Zeek logs for suspicious network behavior.*

---

## Overview
This room teaches how to interpret Zeek logs to identify anomalies, attacker behavior, and network-based threats.

---

## Objectives
- Review Zeek log types  
- Analyze connection metadata  
- Identify suspicious DNS, HTTP, and TLS activity  
- Correlate logs to detect threats  
- Extract IOCs  

---

## Key Concepts Learned
- conn.log  
- dns.log  
- http.log  
- ssl.log  
- weird.log  

---

## Tools Used
- Zeek logs  
- Log viewers  
- Threat intelligence
